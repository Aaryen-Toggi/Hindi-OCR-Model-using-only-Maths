# Handwritten Devanagari Character OCR (From Scratch)

This project implements a **simple OCR system for handwritten Devanagari characters**, built completely from scratch using basic mathematics.

No deep learning frameworks are used — the focus is on **understanding how neural networks work internally**.

---

## 🔍 What This Project Does

- Implements a neural network manually  
- Uses only:
  - **NumPy**
  - **Pandas**
  - Basic math  
- No TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn  
- Explicit implementation of forward pass, backpropagation, and weight updates  

---

## 📊 Results

- **Test Accuracy:** **74%**

Achieved using a simple fully connected neural network.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was built for learning:
- Neural network fundamentals  
- OCR concepts  
- How mathematical operations lead to predictions  

The emphasis is on **clarity and learning**, not performance.
